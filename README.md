# B9_QuantumEntanglement

This repo is built for my B9 project in Oxford. The project is supervised by Professor Alex Lvovsky, and based on a project done before in Berkeley. Details can be seen [here](http://experimentationlab.berkeley.edu/DesignandDocumentationQIE).

Also, people from Colgate University also done [something similar](http://departments.colgate.edu/physics/research/Photon/root/photon_quantum_mechanics.htm).

Professor Lvovsky's book is also recommended for reading.

# Journal Club

While conducting my B9 research project with Professor Lvovsky, I am also participating in his weekly group meetings. The below are some papers the journal club went through and my brief summaries.

## Jan 29, 2020: [Quantum convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03787.pdf)

Made use of quantum circuits. Showed the classification capability of QCNN for quantum states of symmetry protected topological phases. Mentioned potential use in quantum error correction, but not sure how.

## Feb 5, 2020: [Variational quantum unsampling on a quantum photonic processor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10463.pdf)

A quantum circuit is trained to approach the physical system that generates the output state. Clever approach of fixing one qubit state at a time. Generated photons using Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion.

# Literature Review

## Books

Professor Lvovsky's [book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783662565827). 

Professor Mark Beck's [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quantum-Mechanics-Experiment-Mark-Beck/dp/0199798125).

## Experiments conducted in other universities

### [University of Calfornia, Berkeley](http://experimentationlab.berkeley.edu/DesignandDocumentationQIE)

Supervised by Professor Hartmut Haeffner. Included some rough description of the experimental setup and procedure. Also has some useful references pointing to other schools' experiments and papers.

### [Colgate University](https://egalvez.colgate.domains/pql/)

Very comprehensive materials. Even included two videos on alignment. 

### [University of Rochester](http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/lukishova/QuantumOpticsLab/)

Includes some useful resources. In particular, there are [student reports](http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/lukishova/QuantumOpticsLab/2018_links/Lab_1_OPT_253_2018.pdf), [lab manual](http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/lukishova/QuantumOpticsLab/homepage/Lab1_Manual_2018.pdf), and [lecture notes](http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/workgroups/lukishova/QuantumOpticsLab/homepage/Entangl_Bell_Inequal_OPT_253_10_28_09.pdf).

### Dickinson College

A parts [list](http://experimentationlab.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/images/DickinsonPartsCorrected6-2012.pdf) and detailed experimental procedure in this [note](http://experimentationlab.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/images/DickinsonInstructions.pdf).

### [Reed College/Whitman College](http://people.reed.edu/~beckm/QM/)

Not so much on actual experiment procedures. Has a parts list, and also [explanation](http://people.whitman.edu/~beckmk/QM/updates/updates.html) (under 6/25/09) on using an additional single crystral to compensate for the phase difference.

### University of Chicago

A parts [list](http://experimentationlab.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/images/ChicagoPQM_PartsList.pdf).
